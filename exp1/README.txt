p4-fs/exp1 for CS 4414
Submission by Winston Zhang, wyz5rge
Due date 12. May 2023

This is my submission for p4exp1, fsdump.

Description: Students were asked to implement a program named fsdump, that would analyze an EXT2 file system image and return a series of CSV lines describing the attributes of the .img file.
Included files: fsdump.c
Build instructions: Included in my submission is a Makefile. To build my code submission, simply run 'make' in the command line.
                    This will create an executable named fsdump. To run it, use the command './fsdump [filename]', where [filename] is the name of an EXT2 file system image.
